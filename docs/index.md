# Welcome Back

A couple decades ago, when the dotcom bubble and Y2K were the main tech stories, I wrote a curling game called **Granite**. It stood out with accurate physics and pretty good AI (for the time). A couple years later, I wrote Granite2 with better graphics and physics. I sold them by shipping CDs (actual, physical CDs) to retail stores or directly to anybody who wanted one. They did pretty well, but then I got busy with fatherhood and a career, and had to put them aside "for a while".

Twenty-ish years later, I have a little more time so I'm going to try my hand at writing more curling software. The first product is an Apple Watch app called "Curling Time" that includes an activity tracker, 2-split stopwatch, and virtual coin toss. I'm not sure what will be next, but I have a lot of ideas.
